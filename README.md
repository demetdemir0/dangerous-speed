Car game in Python

In this project I programmed a car racing game using Python (PyCharm).
There is a car which has stable speed and rotation on the road, and there is another car which is using by the user. In a random time there will shown a snow piece or
fire to change cars speed.
If user click on the snow piece, automotic car is going to freeze, if user click on the fire, user's car is going to speed up. 
End of the game, user can see best scores and who won the game.
